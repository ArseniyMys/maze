# maze

https://arseniymys.github.io/maze/

The project is a website game which includes a classic labyrinth, a player and a goal. 

The walls of the maze are randomly generated via algorithm. The world and physics are build using Matter.js, a 2D physics engine for the web.

The project is under development, so mobile version is not yet to work.
